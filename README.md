# Predictive Maintenance for IoT-based Public Buses using Unsupervised Clustering

This repository contains the implementation of the methodology presented in papers [1], [2]:

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project implements a predictive maintenance framework that leverages synthetic time-series sensor data and unsupervised learning techniques (K-Means with Euclidean and Dynamic Time Warping metrics) to detect gradual faults in subsystems of IoT-enabled public buses.

The approach includes:
- Synthetic data generation using deep learning and statistical modeling
- Manual injection of temporal trends and degradation patterns
- Clustering-based gradual fault detection on cooling and engine torque systems

## Installation

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes

- The code has been modified to **omit real-world data** for privacy reasons.
- You may need to **update paths** in the scripts depending on your environment.
