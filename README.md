## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project implements a predictive maintenance framework that leverages synthetic time-series sensor data and unsupervised learning techniques (K-Means with Euclidean and Dynamic Time Warping metrics) to detect gradual faults in subsystems of IoT-enabled public buses.

The approach includes:
- Synthetic data generation using deep learning and statistical modeling
- Manual injection of temporal trends and degradation patterns
- Clustering-based fault detection on cooling and engine torque systems
- Evaluation using silhouette scores
